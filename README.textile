h2. Cytoscape Ouplementation of Blueprints Graph API

The goal of this project is implementing CyNetwork API with Blueprints framework 
and make disk-based graph implementations, such as Neo4j, accessible from Cytoscape.

This is a summer student project by mckgamer.

h2. Current Status

We are still trying to make ouplementation code to pass Cytoscape data model's test suite.  Once this phase is done, we start integrating this to Cytoscape 3 Desktop Applicaiton.
